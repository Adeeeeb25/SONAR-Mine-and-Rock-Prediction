🎯 Sonar Mine vs Rock Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning to classify objects as either mines or rocks based on sonar signals. The model is trained on a dataset of sonar returns bouncing off metal cylinders (mines) and rocks beneath the surface. The goal is to help in underwater object detection using a predictive model.

🚀 Project Overview
Problem Statement: Classify whether an object is a rock or a mine based on sonar signal data.

Dataset: Sonar dataset from the Kaggle

Tool: Google Colab (Python-based Jupyter environment)

Approach: Supervised classification using algorithms like Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, or Random Forest (customizable)

📁 Features of Dataset
60 input features (numerical values representing energy in a frequency band)

1 output label:

M = Mine

R = Rock
